        <p className="section-text">
          BlueHaven is a mindful productivity platform designed to help users
          build meaningful habits, reflect on their emotional well-being, and
          gain insights into their daily routines.
        </p>
        <p className="section-text">
          Unlike traditional productivity tools that focus only on output and
          performance, BlueHaven emphasizes balance by combining habit tracking
          with mood logging.

        <h2 className="section-title">Why BlueHaven Exists</h2>
        <p className="section-text">
          In today's fast-paced digital environment, productivity is often
          measured by results alone. This can lead to stress, burnout, and
          emotional disconnect.
        </p>
        <p className="section-text">
          BlueHaven was created to encourage a more sustainable approach —
          one that values emotional awareness alongside consistency and growth.
